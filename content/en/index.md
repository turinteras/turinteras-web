# About Turinteras

Welcome to the website of "Turinteras". We are a group of tourism students from The Open Faculty (Faculty of Tourism at the University of Murcia). This is an initiative that we have carried out in order to create a more inclusive tourism, and bring it closer to disabled people through accessible itineraries.
